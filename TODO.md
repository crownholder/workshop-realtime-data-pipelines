# TODO

![Goal architecture](images/goal_arch.png)

Avro schema in all topics except the 'raw' one (?)

(a couple of plots to show the relation between restaurants' "real score" slow oscillations, individual users' fuzzed review scores, and rolling averages?)

Persistence triggered by either number OR elapsed time

Persistence has another table with entries keyed by datetime also (for "plotting") and TTL

better output

better readme but just what's needed to get all working: (1) DB and (2) showcase REST API curls to directly read off DB

move this repo over to datastaxdevs
